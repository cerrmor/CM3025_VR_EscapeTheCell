# CM3025_VR_EscapeTheCell

This is my submission of the Cap Stone project to CM3025 Virtual Reality.

This VR experience plays like a locked room, the user must solve a series of puzzles to escape.

The course work leading up to the project have also been included such as:
* The Concept pitch
* Game design document
* Pitch video
* Game demo video
